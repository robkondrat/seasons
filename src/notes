Rules of State
Only usable with class components (although can be used with hook system)
You will confuse props with sate
'State' is a JS object that contains data relevent to a component
Updating 'state' on a component causes the component to almost instantly rerender
State must be initialized when a component is created
State can only be updated using the function 'setState'

FLOW (when just displaying current Latitude)
1. JS file loaded by browser
2. Instance of App component is created
3. App components 'constructor' function gets called
4. State object is created and assigned to the 'this.state' property
5. We call geolocation service
6. React calls the components render method
7. App returns JSX, gets rendered to page as HTML
...
8. We get result of geolocation
9. We update our state object with a call to 'this.setState'
10. React sees that we updated the state of a component
11. React calls our 'render' method a second time
12. Render method returns some updated JSX
13. React takes that JSX and updates the content in browser
